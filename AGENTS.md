# AGENTS.md

Guidance for AI agents (Claude / Codex / Gemini) working in this
repo. The yukimemi/* shared conventions live in the
`<!-- kata:agents:* -->` blocks below, sourced from
`yukimemi/pj-base` / `pj-nvim` via `kata apply` — see those for git
workflow, PR review cycle, test / lint commands, and renri's worktree
usage.

The sections above the marker blocks are autocursor-specific and
consumer-owned: edit them freely; `kata apply` won't touch them.

## コンセプト

- **denops 廃止・pure Lua / Neovim 専用**: [`autocursor.vim`](https://github.com/yukimemi/autocursor.vim) (denops/Deno) の後継。イベント駆動で `cursorline` / `cursorcolumn` を点けたり消したりする。「止まったら点く・動いたら消える」が全機能。
- **設定はテーブル一本**: `g:autocursor_*` グローバルは廃止し `setup()` テーブルへ。`debug` は `log_level` + notify ゲートに統合。
- **Convention over Configuration**: `plugin/autocursor.lua` が `:{Enable,Disable}AutoCursor{Line,Column}` を eager 登録。autocmd は `setup()` 起点。コマンド名は denops 版と同一 (既存の keymap を壊さない)。
- **Notify ゲート契約**: background (イベント由来の切り替え) は `log.at` 系、ユーザ起点は `log.echo`。既定 (`notify = false`) では完全に無言。

## テストが mini.test である理由

一般的なテスト / lint コマンドは下の `kata:agents:nvim:*` ブロックにある。ここに
書くのは **この選択の背景** だけ。

`nvim -u NONE -l scripts/run_tests.lua` で走らせるため、子プロセスがユーザの
`~/.config/nvim/init.lua` を読まない。イベント → オプション切り替えという
グローバル状態を触るプラグインなので、ユーザ環境の autocmd や colorscheme が
紛れ込むと結果が信用できなくなる。spec 名は mini.test 既定の **`test_*.lua`**。

`-u NONE` は plugin ディレクトリも読まないので、eager 登録の検証は
`nvim_get_runtime_file("plugin/autocursor.lua")` を明示 `source` して行う
(`tests/autocursor/test_cursor.lua`)。

## アーキテクチャ

### ファイル構成

```text
plugin/autocursor.lua       — :{Enable,Disable}AutoCursor{Line,Column} を eager 登録
lua/autocursor/
  init.lua                  — setup() + Lua API (enable/disable)
  config.lua                — defaults + setup。events の flatten / 重複排除
  log.lua                   — notify ゲート + echo
  cursor.lua                — コア。throttle、set_option()、change()、fix_state() とその timer
  autocmd.lua               — config の events から augroup "autocursor" を構築 / 破棄
  command.lua               — 4 コマンド登録
  health.lua                — :checkhealth autocursor
scripts/run_tests.lua
tests/autocursor/test_*.lua
deps/                       — CI が clone するテスト依存 (mini.nvim)。gitignore 済み
.github/workflows/ci.yml    — kata-managed (yukimemi/pj-nvim)。3 OS × stable/nightly + stylua lint
```

### 切り替えのコア (`cursor.lua`)

- `set_option(option, set, wait)` を throttle (キー = option 名) 経由で実行。閾値は `throttle + wait`。
  **leading edge**: 静止後の最初のイベントは即適用。閾値内に来たイベントは
  `vim.defer_fn` で閾値後にまとめて 1 回だけ適用 (連打を潰す)。`time` は leading edge でのみ
  更新する — denops 版の挙動をそのまま移植している。
- ガード順は denops 版と同じ: `set == state`(既にその状態) → `enable == false` → `ignore_filetypes`。
  `state` は「autocursor が最後に適用した値」で、実オプションとは別物。
- `fix_state()` が `nvim_get_option_value(..., { win = 0 })` で実値を読み `state` を補正する。
  外部の `:set cursorline` で `set == state` ショートサーキットが固まるのを防ぐための
  定期タイマー (`fix_interval`, 0 で無効)。
- `reset()` が保留中の defer と throttle 履歴を捨てる。`reload()` (= setup) と
  `autocmd.unregister()` が呼ぶので、再 setup 後の最初のイベントは必ず leading edge になる。

### 設定マージ (`config.lua`)

`vim.tbl_deep_extend("force", deepcopy(defaults), opts)`。**defaults は必ず deepcopy** してから
マージする (しないと `normalize()` の結果が defaults 側のリストを書き換えてしまう。
`tests/autocursor/test_config.lua` の "setup leaves the defaults table untouched" が番人)。
list は index マージされるため、ユーザの `events` は既定を **置換** する仕様。

## 設計原則

- **点滅させない.** throttle + `wait` で連続イベントを 1 回に潰す。`ignore_filetypes` で
  picker / quickfix 系を除外。
- **状態は必ず実値に追従させる.** 内部 `state` は最適化のためのキャッシュに過ぎず、
  ズレたら `fix_state()` が直す。
- **Notify ゲート契約.** background `log.at` / ユーザ起点 `log.echo`。
- **テスト先行.** イベント → 切り替え、ignore ft、Enable/Disable、throttle の潰し方、
  外部 `:set` の追従、eager 登録を `tests/autocursor/test_*.lua` で守る。時間依存の検証は
  `vim.wait` のポーリングで書き、固定 sleep を前提にしない。

## 移植元との差分 (denops 版からの設計変更)

- `g:autocursor_*` → `setup()` テーブル。`g:autocursor_debug` → `log_level` + notify ゲート。
- denops dispatcher (`setOption` / `changeCursor` / `fixState`) → Lua モジュール関数。
  `User DenopsPluginPost:autocursor` 起点の `fixState` → `setup()` で張る `vim.uv` タイマー。
- `zod` による実行時スキーマ検証は廃止。`events` の正規化 (flatten / dedupe / 既定値) だけ残す。
- `DisableAutoCursor*` で `state` も false に落とす (denops 版は `state` を放置していたため、
  再 Enable 直後のイベントが最大 `fix_interval` 分空振りしていた)。
- Lua API `enable()` / `disable()` を追加。

## Shared conventions

This file is the agent-agnostic source of truth (per the
[agents.md](https://agents.md) convention). The matching
`CLAUDE.md` and `GEMINI.md` files are thin shims that point back
here so each tool's auto-load behaviour still finds something.
**Edit AGENTS.md, not the shims.**

### Git workflow

- **No direct push to `main`.** Open a PR.
  - Exception: trivial typo / whitespace / docs wording fixes.
- Branch names: `feat/...`, `fix/...`, `chore/...`.
- **PR titles + bodies in English. Commit messages in English.**
- **Releases are PR-driven and tagging is automatic** — in repos that
  ship a release pipeline. Bump the version in the project's own
  manifest in a `chore/release-vX.Y.Z` PR; on merge to `main` the
  language layer's `auto-tag.yml` detects the bump, pushes the
  `vX.Y.Z` tag, and that tag is what fires `release.yml`. **Do not run
  `git tag` by hand** — the bot tag will collide and the manual push
  fails. The specifics belong to the layers shipping those two
  workflows, which are not the same layer: `kata:agents:rust:*` for
  which file holds the version and for `auto-tag.yml`,
  `kata:agents:rust-{cli,lib}:*` for what `release.yml` builds and
  publishes. A repo with no `auto-tag.yml` has no release pipeline at
  all: nothing tags, and the version field in its manifest may well
  be decoration.

### PR review cycle

- Every PR runs reviews from **Claude Code**
  (`.github/workflows/claude-review.yml`, kata-managed) and
  **CodeRabbit**. Wait for both bots to post, address their
  comments (push fixes to the PR branch), and merge only after
  feedback is resolved. The claude-review workflow skips
  review-exempt PRs by itself (its job-level `if:` excludes
  `chore/release-*`, `kata-apply/auto`, `apm-bump/auto`, and
  Renovate / Dependabot authors) — a missing Claude review on
  those PRs is expected, not a failure.
- **Any PR that touches the Claude workflow files goes
  unreviewed.** `claude-code-action` requires the workflow file to
  already exist on the default branch **with identical content** —
  otherwise a PR could rewrite the workflow to exfiltrate the
  token. When the content differs it logs "Skipping action due to
  workflow validation" and exits 0 without reviewing: a green
  check with no review attached. This covers two cases, and the
  second is the one that keeps surprising people:
  - the PR that first adopts these templates (the workflow does
    not exist on the default branch yet), and
  - any later PR that **edits** `claude-review.yml` / `claude.yml`,
    e.g. hand-pulling an upstream template fix.

  Not fixable from this side — it is the mechanism that makes the
  token safe to hand to the action at all. Expected: merge on CI +
  owner approval; reviews resume on the next PR that leaves the
  workflows alone. The `kata-apply/auto` branch is already excluded
  by the job-level `if:`, so the daily template-refresh PRs do not
  add noise here.
- **A missing credential fails loudly instead.** If the repo has
  neither `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` nor `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` set,
  the guard step fails the job — set one and re-run (subscription
  path: `claude setup-token` → `gh secret set`; pay-as-you-go:
  store `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and swap the action input to
  `anthropic_api_key`). Distinguishing the two: **red** means no
  credential, **green with no review** means workflow validation.
- **The Claude full review fires once, at PR open** (plus
  `ready_for_review` / `reopened`) — fix pushes do **not** re-trigger
  it (`synchronize` is deliberately off the trigger list; a full
  re-review per push doubled up with the mention-driven re-check
  below and burned tokens for no extra signal). Verification of
  fixes rides the `@claude` thread replies. After a large rework
  that changes the PR's shape, request a fresh full pass
  explicitly: `@claude please re-review the full PR`. CodeRabbit
  still reviews pushes on its own cadence (its app config, not
  this workflow).
- **After opening a PR, immediately enter the review-monitoring
  loop — do not ask the user whether to start it.** Drive the
  cadence with `/loop` — fixed-interval mode (e.g.
  `/loop 60s …`) schedules ticks via `CronCreate`; dynamic mode
  (no interval, `/loop …`) self-paces via `ScheduleWakeup`. The
  agent actively pulls fresh state each tick with
  `gh pr view <N> --json state,reviews,comments,statusCheckRollup`
  and `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<N>/comments` (the
  latter covers inline review comments, which `gh pr view`
  does not surface) and reacts to new bot feedback. Passive
  watchers (background `gh` polls, file watchers, hooks) cannot
  trigger active follow-up, so they are not a substitute —
  without an active wake-up the agent never re-reads the PR.
- **Default polling interval: 60s.** Claude Code review /
  CodeRabbit typically reply within ~1–5 minutes of a push or
  thread reply, so a 60s tick catches them on the next wake-up
  without burning cache: 60s sits well inside the 5-minute
  prompt-cache TTL, so the conversation context stays cached
  across ticks. Do **not** stretch the interval to 300s — that
  is the worst-of-both window (you pay the cache miss without
  amortizing it). If the PR is idle but a bot re-review is still
  expected (e.g. a CodeRabbit rate-limit refill window), step
  **up** to 1200–1800s instead.
- **Stop the loop entirely when only owner approval is missing.**
  Once review bots are quiet (or quiet-by-exception — version-bump
  skip, Renovate/Dependabot skip), CI is green, and there is no
  other expected follow-up, the *only* remaining action is human
  approval. GitHub already notifies the owner; the agent
  re-entering on every cron tick to find the same "still waiting
  on owner" state burns cache and adds no value. Stop scheduling
  further wake-ups (`CronDelete` in fixed-interval mode; simply
  omit the next `ScheduleWakeup` in dynamic mode) and report the
  wait state to the user. The owner restarts the loop after their
  next push if a fresh bot pass is wanted, or merges directly.
  (A CodeRabbit rate-limit window doesn't qualify on its own — a
  re-review is still expected once the quota refills, so step up
  to 1200–1800s instead and let it ride. Stopping is only correct
  when the owner has explicitly chosen to skip the bot pass per
  the rate-limit exception below.)
- **Reply to reviewers after pushing a fix — in each thread, not
  at the top level.** Every finding lives in its own inline review
  thread; answer *each* one as an in-thread reply, carrying an
  **@-mention** (`@claude` / `@coderabbitai`). Use the review-
  comment *replies* endpoint — `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<N>/comments/<comment_id>/replies -f body=…`
  (or `-F in_reply_to=<comment_id> -f body=…` on the comments
  endpoint — `body` is required there too) — and
  get each comment's `<comment_id>` from
  `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<N>/comments`. A single
  top-level `gh pr comment` does **not** count: it leaves every
  inline thread unresolved, the bot can't tie your response to the
  finding it raised, and the per-finding audit trail is lost.
  Reply in-thread even when you're **declining** a suggestion —
  say why; a silent skip reads as overlooked. Note `@claude` also
  triggers the interactive responder
  (`.github/workflows/claude.yml`, kata-managed) — it will
  re-check the fix and reply on the thread. Since fix pushes no
  longer re-trigger the full review, this mention-driven re-check
  is the **only** Claude-side verification of a fix — don't skip
  it for substantive fixes; do skip it for pure FYI notes that
  need no verification.
- A review thread is **settled** the moment the latest bot reply
  is ack-only ("Thank you" / "Understood" / a re-review summary
  with no new findings) or 30 minutes elapse with no actionable
  comment.
- **Merge gate**: review bots quiet AND owner explicit approval.
- Bot-authored PRs (Renovate / Dependabot) skip the bot-review
  gate; CI green + owner approval is enough.
- **Version-bump-only PRs** (a single `chore/release-vX.Y.Z`
  branch whose entire diff is `[workspace.package].version` /
  `[package].version` + the matching inter-crate refs +
  `Cargo.lock`) **also skip the bot-review gate.** There is
  nothing for the bots to find in a version bump, and the
  release pipeline downstream of merge (auto-tag → release.yml)
  is time-sensitive. CI green + owner approval is enough.
- **Treat CodeRabbit rate-limit notices as "quiet" for the
  merge gate.** If CodeRabbit only posts a "Review limit
  reached" quota-exhaustion message (no findings, no inline
  comments), it has produced no review content — there is
  nothing to address. Re-trigger with `@coderabbitai review`
  once the quota refills if you want a real pass; for small or
  time-sensitive PRs, merge on owner approval without waiting.

### Worktree workflow

> **Before your FIRST edit to any file, run `renri add` — NEVER edit the
> main checkout.** Read-only inspection (Read / Grep / Glob) stays on the
> main checkout; the instant you intend to *change* a file, you must
> already be in a worktree. The trap that keeps catching agents: diving
> into a fix the moment the diagnosis lands and editing in place. A
> concurrent agent shares the main checkout — your in-place edits will
> clobber theirs or be clobbered, and in a jj-colocated repo a stray
> working-copy commit entangles unrelated WIP into your branch. If you
> slip and edit in the main checkout, capture the diff first (jj already
> snapshotted it into the working-copy commit, so `jj diff > patch`; for
> git, `git stash` or save a patch — if you got as far as committing on a
> branch, just push it). Then reset the main checkout to pristine main
> (`jj new main@origin`, or `git switch -`), `renri add` a worktree, and
> re-apply the captured diff there.

Use [`renri`](https://github.com/yukimemi/renri) for any
commit-bound change. From the main checkout:

```sh
renri add <branch-name> --from main@origin            # create a worktree (jj-first), off latest upstream main
renri --vcs git add <branch-name> --from origin/main  # force a git worktree, off latest upstream main
renri remove <branch-name> -y --non-interactive  # cleanup after merge (agent-safe; see note)
renri prune                        # GC stale worktrees
```

Read-only inspection can stay on the main checkout.

**Always pass `--from <upstream main>`** (`main@origin` for jj,
`origin/main` for git). Without it, `renri add` forks off the *cwd
worktree's current HEAD* — in a long-lived main checkout that often
lags upstream, so the PR later shows up CONFLICTING against a `main`
that had already moved (e.g. a refactor merged upstream before the
branch was cut), forcing a manual re-port of the whole change.
`renri add` does fetch first, but fetching only updates `main@origin`
— it never moves the checkout's HEAD, so an explicit `--from` is what
guarantees a fresh base.

**Agents / non-interactive shells:** `renri remove` prints a details
panel and waits for a confirmation prompt — without `-y` it **hangs**,
and `--non-interactive` *alone* errors asking for `-y`. Always pass
`-y`, and add `--non-interactive` so a mistyped/omitted name fails
instead of opening a fuzzy picker (the same picker-fallback applies to
`remove` / `cd` / `exec` with no name). Use `-f`/`--force` to remove a
worktree that still has uncommitted changes or conflicts. To sweep
every merged-PR worktree in one shot: `renri remove --merged -y`.

### kata-managed sections

Several files in this repo are managed by `kata apply` from the
[`yukimemi/pj-presets`](https://github.com/yukimemi/pj-presets)
templates — the bytes between `<!-- kata:*:begin -->` and
`<!-- kata:*:end -->` markers, plus the overwrite-always files
listed in `.kata/applied.toml`. **Editing those bytes locally
won't survive the next `kata apply`** — push the change to the
upstream template repo (`yukimemi/pj-base` / `yukimemi/pj-rust` /
…) instead.

The marker scopes are layered, one per applied layer:
`kata:agents:base:*` is this section, and each layer adds its own
(`kata:agents:rust:*`, `kata:agents:rust-cli:*`,
`kata:agents:pnpm:*`, `kata:agents:firebase:*`, …). Which ones apply
*here* is a grep away: `<!-- kata:` in this file.

### This project's own conventions

Everything a layer ships is generic by construction: it describes the
stack the template assumed, not what this repo grew into. **Bytes
outside every marker pair are yours and survive `kata apply`** — so
project-specific conventions belong in a section of their own, outside
the markers (conventionally at the end of the file; if a later layer
appends its block below yours, no matter — kata only ever rewrites
between its own markers). Same mechanism as the `.gitignore` /
`.gitattributes` blocks.

Write those conventions down there rather than leaving them in one
agent's head, in commit archaeology, or in a README the agent will not
read. What earns a line:

- **Any layer default that does not hold here.** A layer states its
  assumption flatly ("Hosting is the primary target", "these rules are
  a placeholder to replace"). When the project has diverged, say so and
  say why — the layer's text keeps asserting the opposite on every
  apply, and an agent that only reads the blocks will act on it.
- **Facts duplicated across files with no compiler in between** — an
  address or a path that appears in code *and* in a rules/config file
  that cannot import it, a timeout that has to stay inside another
  timeout. List every copy, so the next edit finds them all.
- **kata-shipped files this project deleted on purpose**, together with
  the `once_applied = true` line in `.kata/applied.toml` that keeps
  them deleted. Otherwise someone helpfully restores one.
- **Shapes the runtime forces but no tool checks** — an export form a
  platform requires, import specifiers that must (or must not) carry a
  file extension, a directory whose contents are reachable by URL.
- **Invariants that money or access rest on**, naming the file and line
  that actually enforces them.
- **Which language the code speaks versus what a user reads**, when the
  two differ.

A repo whose `AGENTS.md` is nothing but kata blocks is a repo where
every agent re-derives all of that from scratch — and gets the layer
defaults wrong the same way each time.

### Neovim plugin workflow

This repo follows the shared Neovim plugin conventions. The
language-agnostic conventions block above (`kata:agents:base:*`)
covers git workflow, PR review cycle, and worktree usage.

### Test / lint

There is no build step — Lua is interpreted, so the whole gate is
"tests pass and stylua is clean":

```sh
stylua --check .                    # format gate (what CI runs)
stylua .                            # apply formatting
```

Tests run through Neovim itself, one file per invocation. Which
framework is in play depends on `nvim.test_runner` in
`.kata/vars.toml`:

```sh
# test_runner = "mini"  (deps/mini.nvim)
nvim -u NONE -l scripts/run_tests.lua tests/<plugin>/test_foo.lua

# test_runner = "plenary"  (deps/plenary.nvim)
nvim --headless --noplugin -u tests/minimal_init.lua \
  -c "PlenaryBustedFile tests/<plugin>/foo_spec.lua"
```

**Run one file per `nvim` invocation, and match CI's discovery
pattern.** CI enumerates specs with `find tests -type f -name …` and
loops in the shell rather than letting the framework walk the
directory: `PlenaryBustedDirectory` spawns `pwsh` on Windows runners
to enumerate files, and pwsh's ~5s startup blows plenary's internal
timeout. A file-at-a-time loop behaves identically on all three OSes
and keeps a crash in one spec from taking the rest of the suite with
it.

### Test dependencies live in `deps/`

CI clones the framework into `deps/mini.nvim` or `deps/plenary.nvim`.
Keep `deps/` out of the repo (it is in `.gitignore`) and out of
formatting (`.styluaignore`). If your `minimal_init.lua` hardcodes a
different path, fix the init file rather than the workflow — the
workflow is kata-managed and a local edit will be reverted.

### Neovim version support

CI runs the full matrix: `ubuntu` / `macos` / `windows` x `stable` /
`nightly`. A nightly-only failure is still a failure — either guard
the API behind a version check or fix the call. Don't reach for a
newer API without confirming it exists on `stable`; `vim.fn.has()` or
a `pcall` around the lookup is the usual guard.

### Lint / format policy

`.stylua.toml` is kata-managed (sourced from `yukimemi/pj-nvim`).
Edits to it in this repo won't survive the next `kata apply`; if a
setting is wrong, push the fix to `yukimemi/pj-nvim` so every Neovim
plugin using these templates picks it up. `.styluaignore` is
consumer-owned after the first apply — extend it freely.

### CI workflow

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` is kata-managed. The source lives in
`yukimemi/pj-nvim/.github/workflows/ci.yml.tera` (the `.tera` suffix
keeps GitHub Actions from running the source inside pj-nvim itself
and opts the file into kata's Tera rendering). Action versions are
pinned in `.kata/vars.toml` and bumped by Renovate, so don't edit
them inline in the workflow — the bump would be clobbered on the
next apply.

### Auto-merge preconditions (one-time, per repository)

Merging is GitHub's native auto-merge, armed by Renovate
(`platformAutomerge`) and by pj-base's `kata-apply` / `apm-bump`
workflows via `gh pr merge --auto`. Three repo-side settings are
required, and none of them can ship from a template — a freshly
created plugin has to be onboarded by hand, exactly like the pj-rust
and pj-denops lines:

* **`KATA_APPLY_TOKEN` secret** — a PAT with write access to the repo.
  `kata-apply.yml` / `apm-bump.yml` check out and push with it rather
  than `GITHUB_TOKEN`, whose pushes never trigger CI. Without it the
  job dies at checkout with `Input required and not supplied: token`.
* **`allow_auto_merge` enabled** on the repository.
* **Branch protection on `main`** requiring `test (ubuntu-latest /
  nvim stable)` and `stylua`. GitHub only arms auto-merge on a pull
  request that is currently blocked; with no required check the PR is
  immediately mergeable and the request is rejected with
  `Pull request is in clean status` or `Branch does not have required
  protected branch rules`.

Only the ubuntu legs are required on purpose. The macOS / Windows legs
and both nightly legs still run and still have to be read, but a flaky
runner or an upstream nightly regression must not wedge every
dependency PR.

```sh
gh secret set KATA_APPLY_TOKEN --repo yukimemi/<plugin>
gh repo edit yukimemi/<plugin> --enable-auto-merge
gh api -X PUT repos/yukimemi/<plugin>/branches/main/protection --input - <<'JSON'
{
  "required_status_checks": {
    "strict": false,
    "contexts": ["test (ubuntu-latest / nvim stable)", "stylua"]
  },
  "enforce_admins": false,
  "required_pull_request_reviews": null,
  "restrictions": null
}
JSON
```

Skipping these is silent: the plugin looks fine, but `kata-apply`
fails every night and no template update ever reaches the repo.
